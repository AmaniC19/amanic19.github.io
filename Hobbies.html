                        <p>I've been playing nintendo since I was a little kid. My first nintendo system I can remember was the Gamecube
                        I got the gamecube when I was like 5 years old, which was like 2005. During that time, I played games like 
                        Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Sonic Riders, Shrek 2, Tales of Symphonia, Skies of Arcadia, Baten Kaitos,
                        and many more I can't remember. This is the time when I really enjoyed playing video games and made it my passion.
                        Then, later on when the Wii came out, I was addicted to it, especially Super Mario
                        Sluggers, the baseball Mario Game. I had so much fun playing that game, playing against the cheating CPU's lol.
                        I also remembered playing against my brothers and family in Wii sports. I also had a Ds, and mostly for Pokemon.
                        Pokemon I also got attatched to from my uncle. I really enjoyed most of the Pokemon games, especially Heartgold and Soulsilver.
                        After all that, I really became a big fan of nintendo. And this was around the time I was like 9. After that, I continued
                        to get almost every system nintendo came out with, the Wii U and 3ds. I'm really excited for the future of Nintendo.</p>
