                                Tales of Symphonia is a game with two parallel worlds: Sylvarant and Tethe'alla; vying for the little mana that is left from the war. This war is called the Ancient Kharlan War. It was stopped by Mithos the Hero, 4000 years ago. Now, in present time, a new Chosen for the world regenration has come and now will begin her journey to regerernate the world. Her companies at the beginning: Lloyd, Genis, Raine, and Kratos; help her in the process of regenrating the world.

                                Collete has to go to all the seals in Sylvarant and release them. The seals are: Fire, Water, Wind, and Light. With each seal she releases, she bcecomes more of an angel and gets closer to Cruxis. After all the seals are broken, Collete will have to go to the Tower Of Salvation, where she then will become an angel of Cruxis.

                                Before Collete and her companions go to the Tower of Salvation, they learned of Tethe'alla, the world parallel to Sylvarant. As each seal Collete breaks, the mana flow goes from the flourishing world, Tethe'alla, to the declining world, Sylvarant.

                                Charles Lloyd is speaking of the late master drummer: Billy Higgins.
                            </p>
                            <p class="praise">
                                "Let me tell you something: He had the dance-the dance of life. He was a beautiful soul who graced this planet and made it a better place. You know the same sun shines everywhere, but its manifestation in some places is stronger. Billy's spirit was so like that, so all-embracing. I feel him more than ever, but at the same time, I feel protective or something."
                            </p>
                            <p class="praise">
                                "I remember we were getting ready to do a take of 'Dorotea's Studio' [from Voice in the Night], and Billy was looking up at the ceiling. I said, 'What's happening, Master Higgins?' He said, 'I'm trying to think what to play here.' I'd never seen him do that. He said, 'OK,' and played this incredible march. Here's this little Spanish song, and he played dut-dut-dut. It was just swinging, just dancing. That's what he does-he just comes up with what's needed."
